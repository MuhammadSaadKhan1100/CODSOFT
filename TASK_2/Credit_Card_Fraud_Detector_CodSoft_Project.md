# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project 🕵🏻💸🫰🏻
# Overview 💎
Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Detection project repository, which I developed during my internship at Codsoft. This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent credit card transactions and was implemented in Google Colab.

# Project Description 
Credit card fraud is a pervasive issue in the financial industry, costing billions of dollars annually. This project aims to build a fraud detection model capable of identifying suspicious transactions and preventing fraudulent activities. It combines data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning to achieve this goal.

# Key Features 🗝️
Utilized a credit card transaction dataset containing labeled data (fraudulent and non-fraudulent).
Engineered relevant features to improve model performance.
Employed various machine learning algorithms for fraud detection.
Evaluated model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Provided insights into fraudulent transaction patterns.
# Technologies Used 👨🏻‍💻
* Python: The primary programming language for this project.
* Google Colab: Used for data preprocessing, model development, and testing.
* Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
* Scikit-Learn: Used for machine learning model development and evaluation.
* Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.

# Project Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

data: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
notebooks: Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
src: Source code for the credit card fraud detection model.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
# Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the notebooks directory and open the Jupyter notebooks to explore the data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation process.
