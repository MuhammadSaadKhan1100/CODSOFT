# SMS/Email Spam Detection Project 🪣💂🏻‍♀️
# Overview 
Welcome to the SMS/Email Spam Detection project repository, which I developed during my internship at Codsoft. This project focuses on building a machine learning model to automatically classify text messages and emails as either spam or not spam (ham). The project was implemented in Google Colab.

# Project Description
The proliferation of spam messages in our digital communication channels has made it essential to develop efficient spam detection systems. This project aims to create a robust spam detection model capable of identifying and filtering out spam messages effectively. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques.

# Key Features 🔐
Utilized a labeled dataset containing both spam and ham messages for model training.
Employed natural language processing (NLP) techniques to process and analyze text data.
Developed machine learning models for text classification.
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Created a user-friendly interface for spam detection.
# Technologies Used 🖥️🛜👨🏻‍💻
