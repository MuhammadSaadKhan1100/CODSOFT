# Weather Prediction Project ‚òÄÔ∏èüå¶Ô∏è‚õ±Ô∏è
* # Overview:
This repository contains the code and resources for my Weather Prediction project, which I developed during my internship at Codsoft. The project is designed to predict weather conditions using machine learning techniques and was implemented in Google Colab.

# Project Description
Weather prediction is a critical application of machine learning in the domain of environmental science. Accurate weather forecasts are essential for various sectors, including agriculture, transportation, and disaster management. In this project, I aimed to build a weather prediction model that can provide reliable forecasts for a given location and date.

# Key Features üîë
Utilized historical weather data as well as other relevant environmental factors.
Developed machine learning models for weather prediction.
Evaluated model performance using various metrics.
Provided a user-friendly interface for making predictions.
Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for this project.
Google Colab: Used for data preprocessing, model development, and testing.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-Learn: Used for machine learning model development and evaluation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.

# Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

* data: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
* notebooks: Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
* src: Source code for the weather prediction model.
* app: Contains the user-friendly interface for making weather predictions (if applicable).
* README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
# Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the notebooks directory and open the Jupyter notebooks to explore the data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation process.
If an application interface exists (in the app directory), follow the instructions in its README to make weather predictions.
Feel free to use and modify the code for your own purposes, adhering to the license terms specified in the repository.
# Future Improvements
Incorporate real-time weather data for more accurate predictions.
Implement advanced machine learning techniques and algorithms.
Expand the user interface for wider usability.
Optimize the model for better performance and faster predictions.
